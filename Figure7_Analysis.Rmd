## Differences in the positional dependance of firing between rewarded trials, run through trials and trials where the animal "tries" 


trial types :
1. rewarded = animal recieves a reward
2. try = speed in the reward zone is within the 95% confidence interval of speed in the reward zone in
rewarded trials
3. run through = speed in the reward zone is outside the 95% confidence interval of speed in the reward zone in rewarded trials


### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ###


## To address low trial numbers in run through and try catagories, first lets create a new dataset with only high trial numbers. 

First extract number of trials for each type
```{r}
trial_adder <- function(df) {
  df <-
  tibble(
    Rates = as.numeric(df[[1]]),
    Position = as.numeric(df[[3]]),
    Trials = as.numeric(df[[4]])
  )
  
  trials <- length(unique(df$Trials))
  return(trials)
}


spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  mutate(try_trials_number = map(spikes_in_time_try,trial_adder),
         run_trials_number = map(spikes_in_time_run,trial_adder))
```

filter dataset for having enough trials
```{r}
spatial_firing_enoughtrials <- spatial_firing %>%
  filter(run_trials_number > 5 & try_trials_number > 5)
```


### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ###

Then combine hit and miss trials together with an indicator of trial type (hit, try, run)

First, function that extracts data into a tibble, saves space in the function below

```{r}
extract_to_tibble <- function(df) {
  df <-
  tibble(
    Rates = as.numeric(Re(df[[1]])),
    Position = as.numeric(Re(df[[3]])),
    Trials = as.numeric(Re(df[[4]]))
  )
  return (df)
}

```

Function to join firing rates from different trial types and add indicator of the type of trial
```{r}

join_rates <- function(hit, run, try, session_id, cluster_id) {
  if (any(is.na(hit)) | any(is.na(run)) | any(is.na(try))) { 
    return(NA)
  }
  
  hit_df <- extract_to_tibble(hit)
  run_df <- extract_to_tibble(run)
  try_df <- extract_to_tibble(try)
 
  df <- tibble(Rates = c(hit_df$Rates, 
                         run_df$Rates,
                         try_df$Rates), 
               Reward_indicator = c(rep("Rewarded", times=nrow(hit_df)), 
                                    rep("Run", times=nrow(run_df)), 
                                    rep("Try", times=nrow(try_df))), 
               Position = c(hit_df$Position, 
                            run_df$Position, 
                            try_df$Position), 
               Trials = c(hit_df$Trials,
                          run_df$Trials,
                          try_df$Trials))

  return (df)
}

```

1. Generate firing rate tibble for each cell
```{r}
spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  mutate(both_asr_b_by_trial = pmap(list(spikes_in_time_reward, spikes_in_time_run, spikes_in_time_try, session_id, cluster_id), join_rates))

```


Function to run linear model that takes trial type (hit, try, run) into account and use the car package to extract slope significance
```{r}
compare_models_slope_lm <- function(df, run,try){
 # Check for NAs
  if (any(is.na(run)) | any(is.na(try)) | any(is.na(df))) { 
    return(NA)
  }
 df <- df %>%
 filter(Position >= 30, Position <= 90)
 fit <- lme4::lmer(Rates ~ scale(Position) * Reward_indicator + (1+scale(Position) | Trials), data = df, na.action=na.omit)
 modelAnova <- car::Anova(fit)
 
 return (modelAnova$"Pr(>Chisq)"[[3]])
}
```

2. Run linear model on all cells and extract pval
To test just use the first two rows
```{r}
spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  mutate(pval_slope = pmap(list(both_asr_b_by_trial, Avg_FiringRate_RunTrials, Avg_FiringRate_TryTrials), compare_models_slope_lm))
```

Now we can classify cells based on their significance in the above model

First make function to classify neurons
```{r}
mark_neurons_sig <- function(pval){
  if (any(is.na(pval))) {
    return(NA)
  }
  if( pval < 0.01) {
    return( "Significant" )
  } else if( pval >= 0.01) {
    return( "Not-Significant" )
  } else {
    return("None")
  }
}
```

3. Make new column to identify whether cells are significant
```{r}
spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  mutate(reward_interaction_id = map(pval_slope, mark_neurons_sig))
```

### ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ###


## Figure 7 stats

Find proportion & numbers of neurons that are significant/non-significiant

```{r}
ramps <- subset(spatial_firing, lm_group_b == "Negative" | lm_group_b == "Positive")
ramps_with_enough_trials <- subset(ramps, reward_interaction_id != "None" & reward_interaction_id != "NA")
```

```{r}
sig_ramps <- nrow(subset(ramps, reward_interaction_id == "Significant"))/nrow(ramps_with_enough_trials)*100
nonsig_ramps <- nrow(subset(ramps, reward_interaction_id == "Not-Significant"))/nrow(ramps_with_enough_trials)*100
```
```{r}
sig_ramps <- nrow(subset(ramps, reward_interaction_id == "Significant"))
nonsig_ramps <- nrow(subset(ramps, reward_interaction_id == "Not-Significant"))
```



### ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ###

We also want to run a simple linear model for each trial type separately so we can extract the coefficients for each variable. 

First, add position to each of the firing rates individually (before we put them all in one tibble, here we make a seperate one for each and add it back into the dataframe)


Function to add position for individual trial type, returns NAs if those trials are not present 
```{r}
add_position <- function(df, session_id, cluster_id) {
  if(all(is.na(df))){
    print(paste0("All NAs. Session: ", session_id, ". Cluster:", cluster_id))
    df <- tibble(Rates = rep(NA, times=200), 
                 Position = rep(NA, times=200))
    return(df)
    }
  df <- tibble(Rates = unlist(df), Position = rep(1:200)) 
  return(df)
}
```

1. Run this on all animals for try and run through trials (we already have coefficients for rewarded data from Figure 2)
```{r}
spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  mutate(asr_b_try = pmap(list(Avg_FiringRate_TryTrials, session_id, cluster_id), add_position),
         asr_b_run = pmap(list(Avg_FiringRate_RunTrials, session_id, cluster_id), add_position)
         )
```

2. run lm on all cells.
Removes any previously generated results (select), fits the data (mutate) and then adds model outputs as columns to spatial firing (unnest_wider).
```{r}
spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  select(-contains('asr_b_try_fit_')) %>%
  select(-contains('asr_b_run_fit_')) %>%
  mutate(asr_b_try_fit = pmap(list(asr_b_try, 30, 90), lm_helper)) %>%
  mutate(asr_b_run_fit = pmap(list(asr_b_run, 30, 90), lm_helper)) %>%
  unnest_wider(asr_b_try_fit, names_sep = "_", names_repair = "universal") %>%
  unnest_wider(asr_b_run_fit, names_sep = "_", names_repair = "universal")

```

Linear model results are stored in:
spatial_firing$asr_b_try_fit_pval
spatial_firing$asr_b_try_fit_slope
spatial_firing$asr_b_try_fit_r.squared



Now we can plot the slope coefficients for each trial type, marked by whether or not the cells are significantly modulated by trial type (hit, try, run)

1. subset by outbound ramps (Figure 2) and cells that are modulated by position alone (Figure 3)

```{r}
ramps <- subset(spatial_firing, cue_group_o == "Positive-PI" | cue_group_o == "Negative-PI")
```

```{r}
just_position_ramps <- subset(ramps, final_model_o_b == "P")
```

2. Plot slope coefficient for rewarded trials and run through trials
```{r}
plot_slope_comparison <- function(slope1, slope2, factor1){
  df <- tibble(x_slope = slope1, y_slope = slope2, fac = factor1)
  ggplot(data=df, aes(x = x_slope,
                                y = y_slope, 
                                fill = factor(unlist(fac)),
                                color = factor(unlist(fac)))) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-0.55,0.55), y=c(-0.55,0.55)) +
    #coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-0.35,0.35), y=c(-0.35,0.35)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
    geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, colour = "grey", linetype = "dashed") +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "red", "blue")) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "red", "blue")) +
    xlab("slope") +
    ylab(expression("slope")) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size=14),
          legend.position="bottom", 
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          text = element_text(size=14), 
          legend.text=element_text(size=14), 
          axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 20, b = 0, l = 0))) 
}

Now we want to examine if there are differences in the reset activity between trial types (hit, try, run). To do this, we can plot population rate for rewarded and failed trials across whole track. 

Function to join firing rates from different trial types and add indicator of the type of trial

First combine hit and miss trials together with an indicator of trial type (hit, try, run)

Function to join firing rates from different trial types and add indicator of the type of trial
```{r}
join_average_rates <- function(hit, run, try, session_id, cluster_id) {
  if (any(is.na(hit)) | any(is.na(run)) | any(is.na(try))) { 
    return(
      df <- tibble(Rates = rep(NA, times=600), 
               Position = rep(NA, times=600),
               Reward_indicator = c(rep("Rewarded", times=200), rep("Run Through", times=200), rep("Try", times=200)))
    )
  }
  df <- tibble(Rates = c(unlist(hit), unlist(run), unlist(try)), Reward_indicator = c(rep("Rewarded", times=200), rep("Run Through", times=200), rep("Try", times=200)), Position = c(rep(1:200), rep(1:200), rep(1:200)))
  return (df)
}
```

1. Generate firing rate tibble for each cell
```{r}
spatial_firing <- spatial_firing %>%
  mutate(avg_both_asr_b = pmap(list(Avg_FiringRate_HitTrials, Avg_FiringRate_RunTrials, Avg_FiringRate_TryTrials, session_id, cluster_id), join_average_rates))
```


Generic function to plot firing rate ± SEM as a function of position and colour coded according to trial outcome. The function expects to receive the unnested mean firing rates for all neurons that are to be plotted. Conditions for selection should be given before calling the function. Column names of the input data frame should be 'Rates', 'Position' and 'Reward_indicator'.
```{r}
mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome <- function(df, x_start = 00, x_end = 200) {
  df$Rates <- as.double(df$Rates)

 df <- df %>%
   group_by(Position, Reward_indicator) %>%
   dplyr::summarise(mean_b = mean(Rates, na.rm = TRUE),
             se_b = std.error(Rates, na.rm = TRUE))
 
 ggplot(data=df) +
  annotate("rect", xmin=0, xmax=30, ymin=5,ymax=Inf, alpha=0.2, fill="Grey60") +
  annotate("rect", xmin=170, xmax=200, ymin=5,ymax=Inf, alpha=0.2, fill="Grey60") +
  annotate("rect", xmin=90, xmax=110, ymin=5,ymax=Inf, alpha=0.2, fill="Chartreuse4") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=Position, y=mean_b, ymin = mean_b - se_b, ymax = mean_b + se_b,
                  fill=factor(Reward_indicator)), alpha=0.1) +
   geom_line(aes(y=mean_b, x=Position, color=factor(Reward_indicator)), alpha=0.5) +
   scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "red", "blue")) +
   scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "red", "blue")) +
   theme_classic() +
   labs(y = "Mean firing rate (Hz)", x = "Position") +
   xlim(x_start, x_end) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(size=12))
}
```



1. Split data based on cue independant/cue dependant (Figure 5) and encoding group (Figure 3) as we are only interested in position neurons here
```{r}
position_neurons <- filter(spatial_firing, lm_group_b == "Positive" | lm_group_b == "Negative", final_model_o_b == "P" | final_model_o_b == "PS" | final_model_o_b == "PA"| final_model_o_b == "PSA")
```


2. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting          **Negative Negative Continuous**

         lm_group_b_h == "Negative",
         reset_group == "Continuous") %>%

}

```

3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting          **Negative Negative Reset**

  filter(lm_group_b == "Negative",
         lm_group_b_h == "Negative",
         reset_group == "Reset") %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))

         reset_group == "Continuous") %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))


if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/PosPos_Continuous_PI_justposition.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)

  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))

if (save_figures==1) {

}

```

6. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting          **Positive Unclassified**
```{r}

  filter(lm_group_b == "Positive",
         lm_group_b_h == "Negative") %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))


if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/PosNeg_PI_justposition.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}

```

7. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting          **Positive Unclassified**
```{r}
(NegUC_plot <- position_neurons %>%
  filter(lm_group_b == "Negative",
         lm_group_b_h == "Positive") %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%

  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))



if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/NegPos_PI_justposition.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}

```





Repeat above plots but for acceleration encoding neurons

1. Split data based on cue independant/cue dependant (Figure 5) and acceleration encoding group (Figure 3) as we are only interested in these neurons here
```{r}
accel_neurons <- filter(spatial_firing, final_model_o_b == "A",  lm_group_b == "Positive" | lm_group_b == "Negative")
```

2. separate based on whether they have a positive or negative relationship with acceleration
```{r}
accel_neurons_pos <- filter(accel_neurons, o_b_mod_coefs_accel < 0)
accel_neurons_neg <- filter(accel_neurons, o_b_mod_coefs_accel > 0)
```


3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting  **Negative coefficient with acceleration**
```{r}
(Accel_Neg_plot <- accel_neurons %>%
  filter(o_b_mod_coefs_accel > 0) %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))

if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/negative_relationship_waccel.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}

```


3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting **Positive coefficient with acceleration**
```{r}
(Accel_Pos_plot <- accel_neurons %>%
  filter(o_b_mod_coefs_accel < 0) %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))

if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/positive_relationship_waccel.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}
```







Repeat above plots but for all acceleration encoding neurons, regardless of Figure 2 classification

1. Split data based on acceleration encoding group (Figure 3) as we are only interested in these neurons here
```{r}
all_accel_neurons <- filter(spatial_firing, final_model_o_b == "A")
```

2. separate based on whether they have a positive or negative relationship with acceleration
```{r}
accel_neurons_pos <- filter(all_accel_neurons, o_b_mod_coefs_accel < 0)
accel_neurons_neg <- filter(all_accel_neurons, o_b_mod_coefs_accel > 0)
```



3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting **Negative coefficient with acceleration**
```{r}
(All_Accel_Neg_plot <- all_accel_neurons %>%
  filter(o_b_mod_coefs_accel > 0) %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))


if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/negative_relationship_wallaccel.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}

```


3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting **Positive coefficient with acceleration**
```{r}
(All_Accel_Pos_plot <- all_accel_neurons %>%
  filter(o_b_mod_coefs_accel < 0) %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%

if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/positive_relationship_wallaccel.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}
```





Repeat above plots but for speed encoding neurons

1. Split data based on positive/negative slope (Figure2) and speed encoding group (Figure 3) as we are only interested in these neurons here
```{r}
speed_neurons <- filter(spatial_firing, final_model_o_b == "S",  lm_group_b == "Positive" | lm_group_b == "Negative")
```

2.seperate based on whether they have a positive or negative relationship with speed
```{r}
speed_neurons_pos <- filter(speed_neurons, o_b_mod_coefs_speed < 0)
speed_neurons_neg <- filter(speed_neurons, o_b_mod_coefs_speed > 0)
```


3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting          **Negative coefficient with speed**
```{r}

  filter(o_b_mod_coefs_speed > 0) %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))

if (save_figures==1) {
  ggsave(file = "plots/negative_relationship_wspeed.png", width = 4.5, height = 2.5)
}

```


3. Subset data by group then average rates for plotting          **Positive coefficient with speed**
```{r}
(Speed_Pos_plot <- speed_neurons %>%
  filter(o_b_mod_coefs_speed < 0) %>%
  select(avg_both_asr_b) %>%
  unnest(c(avg_both_asr_b)) %>%
  mean_SEM_plots_by_Outcome(0,200))
