```

## Setup

Modified from 'Prelim_Analysis_rewarded' written by Sarah Tennant. Goal here is to load data, functions and required packages. 

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(lme4)
library(ggExtra)
library(ggthemes)
library(scales)
library(Hmisc)
library(Metrics)
library(plotrix)
library(pheatmap) # this package lets you make nice heatmaps
library(RColorBrewer) # import color palettes
library(networkD3) # This package lets you make and plot sankey diagrams

# Import functions
source("Functions.R")
source("Functions_Outbound_LMER.R")

# Load data
# Alternative file names commened out
spatial_firing <- readRDS(file="PythonOutput_Concat.Rda")
#spatial_firing <- readRDS(file="All_Results.Rda") 
# To work on  a subset of data for testing
spatial_firing <-  slice_head(spatial_firing, n = 50)
```



***Warning***
Spatial firing is a very large object. Even running str takes many minutes.
Look at how we can fix this?

This code chunk can be used to find out about spatial firing
```{r}
options(max.print = 1000)
dim(spatial_firing)
# Things measured:
colnames(spatial_firing)
# Cells:
# row.names(spatial_firing)
# stop from printing too much if looking at variables


options(max.print = 10)
```
